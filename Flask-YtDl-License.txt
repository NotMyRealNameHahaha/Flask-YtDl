DON'T BE A DICK PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick.

Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.
1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick.
1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.
1d. Using this software to do anything that is illegal or has a negative impact on someone else. The worst kind of dick would also then blame the author(s) for repercussions of violating laws or just being a dick to others.

If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work, share the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's creator(s) a pint.

Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back.
